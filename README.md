  <p> The Dashboards store is a collection of PowerBi dashboards and SQL scripts that can be used to quickly leverage a schoolboard's data warehouse. It is designed to be used by schoolboard's data analysts to quickly build and deploy dashboards. It's free. </p>

## Sponsor
The core.dashboard_store is sponsored and developped by [Sciance Inc](https://sciance.ca/). We provide data analytics and data science services to school boards and other educational institutions. We are passionate about helping students and educators by providing them with the tools and insights they need to succeed. We believe that by sharing our work, we can help others and make the world a better place, or, at least, a world without pie charts (a small win, but a win nonetheless).

## Spreading analytic in education
If you are interested in either **contributing** or **deploying** the store or our predictive models, please contact us :
