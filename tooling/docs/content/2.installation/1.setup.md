# Let's configure your machine
> Let's venture into the darkness of Ubuntu and set-up your machine, shall-we ?

::alert{type="info"}
Every command, unless specified otherwise, is to be run in the **Ubuntu** terminal.
::

## What you will need 

::list{type="primary"}
- A working computer from the last decade, **with Linux / Ubuntu** *(or a potato connected to the Internet (a Minitel won't work))*.
- A **Microsoft SQL Server** database, with two **databases** : `prod` and `dev`. In the docs, the databases are called `store_dev` or `store_prod`. Feel free to use any name you want for as long as you can remember it.
- A database user, with **read-write** access to the database. In the docs, the user is called `store_user`. Once again, name-it as you wish !

## Prepare your environement

1. Install required dependencies

```bash
apt -y update && \
    apt -y upgrade && \
    # Install helpers
    apt -yq install curl \
    software-properties-common \
    unzip \
    zip \
    # Install Python
    python3 \
    python3-distutils \
    python3-dev \
    unixodbc-dev \
    # Install Git and SSH 
    openssh-client \
    git 
```

2. Install the Microsoft SQL ODBC Driver 2017

```bash
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add - && \
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -rs)/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list && \
apt -y update && ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt -y install msodbcsql17
```

3. Install a modern Python Package Manager : **poetry**


```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

4. Add **Poetry** to your PATH

::alert{type="warning"}
The next command update the PATH through `~/.profile`. Feel free to tailor this command to your own needs.
::

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile && \
source ~/.profile
```

# Did I do everything right ?  
::alert{type="warning"}
Test thoose commands **in a new Linux terminal (bash)**, this to make sure your **PATH** variable has been properly updated.
::


* Python

```bash
python3 --version  # Should return something like : Python 3.10.0
```

* Poetry

```bash
poetry --version  # Should return something like : Poetry version 1.1.11
```

::alert{type="danger"}
If you got a `poetry / python3 command not found`, you might want to make sure Python3 AND Poetry are actually in your PATH variable.
